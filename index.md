# About Me

<p align="center">

</p>

I'm an aspiring data scientist based out of Atlanta, GA. I'm a graduate student currently pursuing a MS degree in computer science (machine learning specialization) with 3+ years of experience in course and project work related to machine learning and data science. I am proud to have developed a creative, collaborative, and open-minded portfolio and invite you to learn more about my work.

## A Little About Me <!-- omit in toc -->

### Aspiring Data Scientist <!-- omit in toc -->

I chose data science as a career because I believe that data is a story, and I want to be the one to tell the story. My journey into data science started as a developed interest in data analysis in my undergraduate years, after I became more comfortable with programming. Through project work I had the opportunity to design data visualizations to understand trends or patterns in data. Then I eventually developed an interest in machine learning (ML) given the reason that I could learn more from data. When I first started studying ML, I mostly learned what it was and what it could do, but throughout my time in graduate school, I learned more of how and why it works. Through project work, I had the opportunity to apply machine learning to different domains and I worked with different ML models to develop insight from data. But most importantly, I learned I have the capability to leverage my technical knowledge to push a project or idea forward in a meaningful way, by analyzing results and drawing effective conclusions on how to proceed. I describe of myself as a creative thinker, problem solver, and person who doesn't mind a challenge.
